# Used Car Price Prediction

## üìù Overview

This project aims to predict the selling price of used cars based on various features like the car's manufacturing year, kilometers driven, fuel type, and more. The project explores the entire machine learning workflow from data cleaning and feature engineering to model training and evaluation.

## üíæ Dataset

The project uses the `car data.csv` dataset, which contains information about used cars listed for sale. The key features include:
* `Year`: The year the car was manufactured.
* `Present_Price`: The current showroom price of the new car (in lakhs).
* `Kms_Driven`: The distance the car has traveled.
* `Fuel_Type`: The type of fuel the car uses (Petrol, Diesel, CNG).
* `Seller_Type`: Whether the seller is a Dealer or an Individual.
* `Transmission`: The car's transmission type (Manual or Automatic).
* `Selling_Price`: The price the car was sold for (in lakhs) - **This is the target variable.**

## ‚öôÔ∏è Project Workflow

1.  **Data Loading & Cleaning:** The dataset was loaded using Pandas and checked for any missing values. The data was found to be clean with no null entries.
2.  **Data Preprocessing:** Categorical features (`Fuel_Type`, `Seller_Type`, `Transmission`) were converted into a numerical format using one-hot encoding.
3.  **Feature Engineering:** A new, more intuitive feature `Car_Age` was created by subtracting the manufacturing `Year` from the current year (2025). This replaced the original `Year` column to improve model performance.
4.  **Model Training:** The data was split into training (80%) and testing (20%) sets. Two different regression models were trained on this data.
5.  **Evaluation:** The performance of both models was evaluated using the **R-squared ($R^2$) metric**.

## ü§ñ Models and Performance

Two models were trained and evaluated to predict the selling price:

* **Random Forest Regressor:** Achieved an excellent $R^2$ score of **0.97**.
* **XGBoost Regressor:** After feature engineering, this model achieved an $R^2$ score of **0.96**.

Both models demonstrated high accuracy, indicating that the features are strong predictors of a used car's selling price.

## üíª Technologies Used

* **Python**
* **Pandas** for data manipulation
* **Scikit-learn** for data splitting and modeling (Random Forest)
* **XGBoost** for advanced modeling
* **Jupyter Notebook** as the development environment
